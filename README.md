# Project description
In this project we implemente an approach to an anomaly de tection system designed for end hosts based on graphlets. Using the concept of graphlets, one can build a profile of an end host based on its IP traffic, and therefore, predict malicious hosts by anomolous activities. 

In the notebook we covere the forthcoming sections: 

a. Solving a graphlet exercise 

b. Building activity and profile graphlets of the provided labeled dataset 

c. Implementation an anomaly detection model with a SVM and high di mensional RWK feature vectors 

d. Implementation an anomaly detection model with a SVM by applying the kernel trick 

e. Discussion of potential false positives and false negatives f. Analysis of the model with a test dataset 

g. Testing the model with unlabeled data to detect potential attacks
